# Factory Method Advanced Challenge: Vehicles with specific features and behaviors
**Description:**

The above challenge can be enhanced in several ways to make it more complex and interesting. Some ideas to level up the exercise are:

## 1. implement specific features and behaviors for each vehicle type:

- **Car:**
    - Number of doors
    - Fuel type (gasoline, diesel, hybrid, hybrid, electric)
    - Maximum speed
    - Load capacity
- **Motorcycle:**
    - Displacement
    - Transmission type (manual, automatic)
    - Weight
    - Off-road capability
- **Truck:**
    - Trailer type (flatbed, tanker, tow truck)
    - Maximum load weight
    - Dimensions (length, width, height)
    - Fuel consumption

## 2. Implement a system that allows the user to choose the type of vehicle to be created:

- An interactive menu can be created that presents the available options to the user.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) can be used to allow the user to select the type of vehicle visually.

## 3. Implement a vehicle rental system:

- Classes can be created to represent the different rental types (hourly, daily, mileage).
- A reservation system can be implemented to allow the user to reserve a vehicle in advance.
- The rental price can be calculated based on the type of vehicle, the duration of the rental and the kilometers traveled.

## 4. Implement a traffic simulation system:

- Classes can be created to represent the different traffic elements (roads, intersections, traffic lights).
- AI-controlled vehicles can be created to drive on the roads and obey traffic rules.
- Different traffic situations can be simulated, such as traffic jams, accidents and road works.

## 5. Implement a fleet management system:

- A class can be created to represent a fleet of vehicles.
- Functions can be implemented to add, delete and modify vehicles in the fleet.
- Reports can be generated on fleet usage, such as mileage traveled, fuel consumption and maintenance costs.
